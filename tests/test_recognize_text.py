"""
ðŸ“¸ Test Module â€“ Image Captioning with CLIP/BLIP

This test validates that the image captioning system correctly identifies car-related content.
It focuses on detecting either known car brands or general car-related keywords.

ðŸ§ª Note: These tests serve just as examples for a car-related use case.
They are not required to run the core app, but they demonstrate how to validate the behavior
of the image captioning pipeline â€” especially useful since CLIP/BLIP outputs can be inconsistent.

ðŸ’¡ To run from the project root:
    pytest tests/test_recognize_text.py
